abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) can deliver personalized scaffolds to support large volume defect tissue regeneration — a major clinical challenge in many medical disciplines. The freedom in scaffold design and composition (biomaterials and biologics) offered by AM yields a plethora of possibilities but is confronted with a heterogenous biological regeneration potential across individuals. A key challenge is to make the right choice for individualized scaffolds that match biology, anatomy, and mechanics of patients. This review provides an overview of state-of-the-art technologies, that is, in silico modelling for scaffold design, omics and bioinformatics to capture patient biology and information technology for data management, that, when combined in a synergistic way with AM, have great potential to make personalized tissue regeneration strategies available to all patients, empowering precision medicine.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 constituted a trigger to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution, heavily focused in the interconnectivity of the systems, bringing disruptive technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM). On top of that, the shift from an industrial economy to a knowledge-based economy, where knowledge is the actual raw material, is implicating changes on the labor market, as new jobs strongly rely on knowledge-intensive activities. This is forcing organizations to rethink their way to operate, since markets are getting even more competitive and susceptible to greater volatility. Herewith organizations are resorting to AM as way to strengthen competitive position, as this technology allows to seize new opportunities. As response to that, this paper presents an industry analysis to AM based on Porter’s Five forces model, where forces such as threat of new entrants, bargaining power of customers, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of suppliers and rivalry among the existent competitors will be discussed under a knowledge perspective. The compiled evidence show that AM industry will plausibly suffer from a high rivalry in the next few years, as consequence of the increased power of customers and suppliers, low entry barriers for new entrants and due to pressures for a more sustainable society. Although these forces will not be totally controllable, organizations can plan their business strategy according to the knowledge they have on them. This type of approach will allow organizations to influence these forces more closely and at the same time to predict possible scenarios, identify tendencies and map the sector. In the present paper is proposed a conceptual model based on Porter’s five forces to analyze the impact of AM on firms’ strategy. For future development this model will be extended to organizations operating with AM in Portugal for validating its practical applicability, which will be performed through questionnaire and/or case study.}

abstract = {3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology's benefits. This technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.}

abstract = {The traditional healthcare method follows ‘one-size-fits-all’ criteria, which shows some limitations in rendering proper results due to varied pharmacokinetic traits of different patients. Each patient shows a different result to a set of prescribed medicines with respect to other patient. In addition, this empirical criterion is also vulnerable to develop unfavourable side-effects due to overdose or under-dose. The advancements in the field of pharmacogenetic testing has paved the way for searching solutions to achieve the goal of ‘personalized medicine’. This concept has the potential to provide more effective results as compared to the traditional technique. The technology of additive manufacturing or 3D printing can cater the need of the patient-centric principle. A wide range of 3D printing techniques provide the independence to work with a number of bio-materials. This paper carries out a systematic review methodology based on the application of this novel technology in the field of drug delivery. The materials, methods of drug administration, techniques used for printing have been elaborated along with the manufacturing of polypills with varied release profiles and geometries. Certain in vivo studies has also been reported to assess the feasibility of this technology. The concept of 4D printing in this direction has also been discussed. Finally, some excerpts on estimated future scope have also been illustrated.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to apply artificial neural networks as deep learning tools in establishing a model for understanding and prediction of diazepam release from fused deposition modeling (FDM) printed tablets. Diazepam printed tablets of various shapes were created by a computer-aided design (CAD) program and prepared by fused deposition modeling using previously prepared polyvinyl alcohol/diazepam filaments via hot-melt extrusion. The surface to volume ratio (SA/V) for each shape was calculated. Printing parameters were varied including infill density (20%, 70% and 100%) and infill pattern (line and zigzag). Influence of tablet SA/V ratio and printing parameters (infill density and infill pattern) on the release of diazepam from printed tablets were modeled using self-organizing maps (SOM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). SOM as an unsupervised neural network was used for visualizing interrelation among the data, whereas MLP was used for the prediction of drug release properties. MLP had three layers (with structure 2-3-5) and was trained using back propagation algorithm. Input parameters for the modeling were: infill density and SA/V ratio; while output parameters were percent of drug release in five time points. The data set for network training was divided into training, validation and test sets. The dissolution rate increased with higher SA/V ratio, lower infill density (less than 50%) and zigzag infill pattern. The established ANN model was tested; calculated f 2 factors for two tested formulations (70.24 and 77.44) showed similarity between experimentally observed and predicted drug release profiles. Trained MLP network was able to predict drug release behavior as a function of infill density and SA/Vol ratio, as established design space for formulated 3D printed diazepam tablets.}

Examining how to upgrade these tools may uncover options to better support or increase biodiversity of coral reefs. As many of the issues facing reef restoration today deal with the scalability and effectiveness of restoration efforts, there is an urgency to invest in technology that can help reach ecosystem-scale. Here, we provide an overview on the evolution to current state of artificial reefs as a reef reformation tool and discuss a blueprint with which to guide the next generation of biomimetic artificial habitats for ecosystem support. Currently, existing artificial structures have difficulty replicating the 3D complexity of coral habitats and scaling them to larger areas can be problematic in terms of production and design. We introduce a novel customizable 3D interface for producing scalable, biomimetic artificial structures, utilizing real data collected from coral ecosystems. This interface employs 3D technologies, 3D imaging and 3D printing, to extract core reef characteristics, which can be translated and digitized into a 3D printed artificial reef. The advantages of 3D printing lie in providing customized tools by which to integrate the vital details of natural reefs, such as rugosity and complexity, into a sustainable manufacturing process. This methodology can offer economic solutions for developing both small and large-scale biomimetic structures for a variety of restoration situations, that closely resemble the coral reefs they intend to support.}

abstract = {The literature already discussed about how the synergic implementation of Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigms in industrial contexts could enable improvements in Supply Chain (SC) efficiency and competitiveness. However, the experts concentrated on a single topic of circular supply chain (CSC), CE, and I4.0, lacking a systemic approach to the integrated context. To this aim, the paper proposes a systematic literature review investigating and systematizing the knowledge around the circular SC domain enabled by CE and I4.0 and, simultaneously, highlighting the major trends. Starting from six dimensions of analysis (Type of contribution, LC phases, I4.0 technologies, Triple Bottom Line (TBL) layers, CE strategies, and SC typologies), CSC-related articles have been classified basing on five thematic categories (I4.0 enabling technologies, Performance tools and indicators, Challenges and barriers, Business models and strategies, Best practices). Results allowed to provide some peculiarities of each category. From a sustainability side, they confirmed a predominance of economic and environmental aspects over social ones, together with a life cycle perspective. From an I4.0 side, they shown a prevalence and a synergic implementation of internet of things, big data analytics, and cloud technologies. From a CE strategy side, reuse-recycle-remanufacturing, waste management, material and energy efficiency have been identified as prevalent topics. The paper contributes in building an integrated knowledge of the threefold CE, CSC and I4.0 research context. In addition, it proposes a theoretical framework useful to gradually guide practitioners in approaching the CSC transition. Depending on different CSC aspects, managers could easily raise their knowledge about practices, methodologies, and technological solutions helpful to support their CSC activities.}

Therefore, an integrated methodology of Design for Manufacturing approach is proposed for additive manufacturing in this paper. This methodology investigates the characteristics related to Additive Manufacturing in design stage. For this purpose, Skin-Skeleton approach is used to model the procedure from the first step to final one. This skin-skeleton model consists of usage and manufacturing model which are used to present the customer requirement, product specification and design trend by usage model as well as manufacturing procedure and its constraints by manufacturing model. For this purpose, Topological optimization and Power Crust algorithm are utilized as tools to present optimized usage skin and skeleton. Also, manufacturing model is presented due to AM characteristics. Therefore, this model helps us to identify usage and manufacturing attributes to provide an interface model to define the product model by analysis of different parameter related to design and manufacturing and their relations comprehensively. Therefore, this model permits to consider manufacturing constraints and attributes as soon as possible in design stage to provide a better solution as a final product model for design and manufacturing concurrently as an integrated approach. In order to validate this approach, a bag hook that produced by Fused Deposition Modelling which is a well-known additive manufacturing technique is used.}

Even though additive manufacturing (AM) technologies possess the capability to personalize final products, they cannot be used for mass production of the 3D printed job on a large scale. Their inability to perform production processes for large-sized objects adds to the disadvantages. Consequently, the industries are hesitant regarding the idea of AM techniques to carry out commercial productions. Therefore, this research-based study aims to efficiently identify and utilize Industry 4.0 technologies to improve AM processes' reliability and mass 3D print smart materials for manufacturers globally. We explore the requirement for Industry 4.0 technologies for AM processes and study the advantages of the application of information technologies (IT) in AM. Further, we analyze how the Internet of Things (IoT) additive manufacturing integrated techniques will benefit the industries and material manufacturers. However, the paperwork is confined to theoretical work. Since automation in AM is a fledgling concept, the available material for research-based study is limited. We conclude that IoT application in AM improves production processes' efficiency followed by reduced manufacturing waste and fulfilled customer specifications. AM has become an essential industrial technique for product innovation and development, therefore, it is necessary to bring reforms to make this technology customer-friendly.}

Therefore, this paper offers a collective insight into the issues affecting construction firms from Covid-19 regarding lockdown rules and the role of 4IR technologies. Given the unexplored nature of the problem, a virtual face-to-face type of qualitative research method was employed. Twelve semi-structured interviews from selected construction firms and consultant experts were engaged and collated data analysed via a thematic approach. Findings group the 4IR technologies into smart construction site, simulation and modelling, and digitisation and virtualisation in Nigeria’s context, and majority of the 4IR technologies can be useful to enhance Covid-19 compliance. Reluctant to adopt, high implementation cost, inadequate knowledge management, resistance to change, among others emerged as the factors hindering 4IR technologies usage. Findings will strengthen and provide a rich insight into the impact of Covid-19 on construction sites and contribute towards informing key stakeholders to create an enabling environment for the implementation of 4IR technologies on site.}

abstract = {Renewable energy resources have enabled the mitigation of global environmental pollution and sustainable energy generation. Due to renewability, cleanliness, and vast sustainability aspects of wind energy, wind power generation (WPG) systems have recently found rapid development. In this study, the sustainability aspects of WPG systems are briefly summarized by comparing the sustainability parameters for various sources of WPG. The techno-socio-economic, aesthetic, and cultural impacts of conventional wind farms and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the accomplishment of new wind energy projects were also discussed. The study aims to visualize the intellectual background, current research status and state-of-the-art knowledge structure of WPG-related literature using CiteSpace based scientometric investigation. The WPG-related original articles, published from 2005 to 2020, were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. The most prolific publications, countries and journals involved in the flourishment of WPG research were identified. Moreover, visualization methods were employed to determine the highly productive articles, keywords, hotspots, and research frontiers in the WPG domain. Furthermore, the classification of WPG knowledge was performed in the form of clusters and knowledge structure to achieve ten distinct sub-domains. It was revealed that China was the most prominent country among others in the research of WPG, holding 29% of the total publications; the most probable reason is the more assertive funding support policy from the Chinese government and research institutions, compared to other countries. This study can help the researchers to spot the new research frontiers and distinguish among the most critical sub-domains of WPG based knowledge.}

Firms can stay competitive using the benefits of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, social computing, Cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, big data and analytics, wireless networks, artificial intelligence, robotics, simulation, etc. The spread of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) all over the world has created a better understanding of the importance of organizations’ ability to keep up with digital innovations. Therefore, the regeneration of business models is becoming an increasingly crucial factor for survival in the digital age. This study develops a process model for digital innovations-driven business model regeneration based on the design science research approach. For this purpose, the existing models and cases in the business model innovation (BMI) literature are examined and the empirical data are collected using semi-structured interviews to complement and validate this knowledge. The collected data are then analyzed and a digital innovations-driven business model regeneration method is developed. The proposed model is demonstrated with a real case. This study extends the BMI literature. The proposed process model can be used by strategic managers to analyze the impacts of potential digital innovations on their current business models and regenerate their business model. Therefore, it can help companies to be able to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors or sustain their business against technological developments.}

Digital datasets of crown design were best-fit aligned with the original teeth to evaluate profile and volume discrepancies of the occlusal morphology, and difference in the functional cuspal angle. Milled and sintered lithium disilicate crowns were resin-luted to 3D-printed dental casts and were subjected to axial load-to-fracture test. The fracture loads and failure modes were recorded and examined. Repeated measures ANOVA with LSD post-hoc test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, paired t-test, and chi-square exact test were used for statistical analyses (α = 0.05). BI-generated crowns showed the highest occlusal profile discrepancy (0.3677 ± 0.0388 mm), whereas human-CAD designed crowns showed higher conformity to the original teeth (0.3254 ± 0.0515 mm for TD, 0.3571 ± 0.0820 for AD; z-difference method; p < 0.001). Cusp angle values were significantly different in all groups except BI and TD (54.76 ± 3.81° for the original teeth, 70.84 ± 4.31° for BI, 67.45 ± 5.30° for TD, and 62.30 ± 7.92° for AD; p < 0.001). Although all three groups of crown designs could achieve clinically acceptable fracture resistance (1556.09 ± 525.68 N for BI, 1486.00 ± 520.08 N for TD, 1425.77 ± 433.34 for AD; p = 0.505) such that no significant difference in fracture strength was found, most crowns presented catastrophic bulk fracture that was not clinically restorable because of the substrate fracture. Group BI had a significantly higher percentage of restorable substrate damage than TD (p = 0.014) and AD (p < 0.001). In conclusion, in designing lithium disilicate dental crown, CAD design with human may be better than knowledge-based AI.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how we exist in the world. In almost every sector of society, AI is performing tasks with super-human speed and intellect; from the prediction of stock market trends to driverless vehicles, diagnosis of disease, and robotic surgery. Despite this growing success, the pharmaceutical field is yet to truly harness AI. Development and manufacture of medicines remains largely in a ‘one size fits all’ paradigm, in which mass-produced, identical formulations are expected to meet individual patient needs. Recently, 3D printing (3DP) has illuminated a path for on-demand production of fully customisable medicines. Due to its flexibility, pharmaceutical 3DP presents innumerable options during formulation development that generally require expert navigation. Leveraging AI within pharmaceutical 3DP removes the need for human expertise, as optimal process parameters can be accurately predicted by machine learning. AI can also be incorporated into a pharmaceutical 3DP ‘Internet of Things’, moving the personalised production of medicines into an intelligent, streamlined, and autonomous pipeline. Supportive infrastructure, such as The Cloud and blockchain, will also play a vital role. Crucially, these technologies will expedite the use of pharmaceutical 3DP in clinical settings and drive the global movement towards personalised medicine and Industry 4.0.}

Deep learning algorithms are applied to the detection and classification of edges and nodes in cracks forming in the drying stage of the loess/water mixture system. Deep learning is shown to effectively detect and classify cracks in terms of nodes and edges.

Our objective in this study was to attempt to predict the likelihood of conception occurring by d 100 and 150 of lactation (days in milk, DIM) by Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis using test day milk recording data and reproductive records gathered retrospectively from 8,750 cows from 33 dairy herds located in the United Kingdom. Overall, 65% of cows recalved with 30, 46, and 65% of cows conceiving by 100 DIM, 150 DIM, and beyond 150 DIM, respectively. Overall conception rate (total cows pregnant/total number of inseminations) was 27.47%. Median and mean calving to conception intervals were 123 and 105 d, respectively. The probability of conception by both 100 DIM and 150 DIM was positively associated with the average daily milk weight produced during the fourth week of lactation (W4MK) and protein percentage for test day samples collected between 0 to 30 and 31 to 60 DIM. Butterfat percentage at 0 to 30 DIM was negatively associated with the probability of conception by 100 DIM but not at 150 DIM. High somatic cell count (SCC) at both 0 to 30 and 31 to 60 DIM was negatively associated with the probability of conception by 100 DIM, whereas high SCC at 31 to 60 DIM was associated with a reduced probability of conception by 150 DIM. Increasing parity was associated with a reduced odds of pregnancy. Posterior predictions of the likelihood of conception for cows categorized as having “good” (W4MK >30kg and protein percentage at 0 to 30 and 31 to 60 DIM >3.2%) or “poor” (W4MK <25kg and protein percentage at 0 to 30 and 31 to 60 DIM <3.0%) early lactation attributes with actual observed values indicated model fit was good. The predicted likelihood of a “good” cow conceiving by 100 and 150 DIM was 0.39 and 0.57, respectively (actual observed values 0.40 and 0.59). The corresponding values for a “poor” cow were 0.28 and 0.42 (actual observed values 0.26 and 0.37). Predictions of the future reproductive success of cows may be possible using a limited number of early lactation attributes.}

Active research in pharmaceutical 3DP has led to a wealth of data that machine learning could utilize to provide predictions of formulation outcomes. A balanced dataset is critical for optimal predictive performance of machine learning (ML) models, but data available from published literature often only include positive results. In this study, in-house and literature-mined data on hot melt extrusion (HME) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3DP formulations were combined to give a more balanced dataset of 1594 formulations. The optimized ML models predicted the printability and filament mechanical characteristics with an accuracy of 84%, and predicted HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 5.5 °C and 8.4 °C, respectively. The performance of these ML models was better than previous iterations with a smaller and a more imbalanced dataset, highlighting the importance of providing a structured and heterogeneous dataset for optimal ML performance. The optimized models were integrated in an updated web-application, M3DISEEN, that provides predictions on filament characteristics, printability, HME and FDM processing temperatures, and drug release profiles (https://m3diseen.com/predictionsFDM/). By simulating the workflow of preparing FDM-printed pharmaceutical products, the web-application expedites the otherwise empirical process of formulation development, facilitating higher pharmaceutical 3DP research throughput.}

In this review study, a particular focus is placed on understanding computational modeling techniques employed for the design, manufacturing, and performance analysis of AM porous scaffolds. Therefore, progress in material synthesis and associated challenges are reviewed in this study, and conclusions and future research recommendations are drawn based on reviewed literature.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional printing (3DP) has made significant advancements in the field of oral drug delivery with personalized drug-loaded formulations being designed, developed and dispensed for the needs of the patient. The FDM 3DP process begins with the production of drug-loaded filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME), followed by the printing of a drug product using a FDM 3D printer. However, the optimization of the fabrication parameters is a time-consuming, empirical trial approach, requiring expert knowledge. Here, M3DISEEN, a web-based pharmaceutical software, was developed to accelerate FDM 3D printing using AI machine learning techniques (MLTs). In total, 614 drug-loaded formulations were designed from a comprehensive list of 145 different pharmaceutical excipients, 3D printed and assessed in-house. To build the predictive tool, a dataset was constructed and models were trained and tested at a ratio of 75:25. Significantly, the AI models predicted key fabrication parameters with accuracies of 76% and 67% for the printability and the filament characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the AI models predicted the HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 8.9 °C and 8.3 °C, respectively. Strikingly, the AI models achieved high levels of accuracy by solely inputting the pharmaceutical excipient trade names. Therefore, AI provides an effective holistic modeling technology and software to streamline and advance 3DP as a significant technology within drug development.

Predicting the wear rate being a complex phenomenon, a fuzzy logic based expert system is proposed to evaluate the wear characteristics of SIS made HDPE specimens. Experiments are conducted using pin-on-disc wear testing apparatus to examine the wear rate. Comparative evaluation of experiments and fuzzy approach suggested that the obtained average error of wear rate using fuzzy system is concord with experimental results.

Herein, literature-mined data for developing AI machine learning (ML) models was used to predict key aspects of the 3DP formulation pipeline and in vitro dissolution properties. A total of 968 formulations were mined and assessed from 114 articles. The ML techniques explored were able to learn and provide accuracies as high as 93% for values in the filament hot melt extrusion process. In addition, ML algorithms were able to use data from the composition of the formulations with additional input features to predict the drug release of 3D printed medicines. The best prediction was obtained by an artificial neural network that was able to predict drug release times of a formulation with a mean error of ±24.29 min. In addition, the most important variables were revealed, which could be leveraged in formulation development. Thus, it was concluded that ML proved to be a suitable approach to modelling the 3D printing workflow.}

The high degree of specialization has recently led to an increased aim to reduce system complexity while still achieving the desired functionality. To this end, 4D-printing is an advantageous approach since it results in systems that can be externally controlled through specific environmental stimuli (temperature, humidity, light, etc.) without the necessity of solid-state circuitry and control algorithms. This chapter deals with functionalized sensor systems based on additive fabrication technologies and their combinations. An outline of how these can be beneficially applied to robotics and wearable medical applications for human-device interfaces is given together with an outlook into the developments toward 4D-printing and promising future applications.}

abstract = {Plastic and polymers are late entrants in the repository of engineering materials, compared to bronze and iron (early phases of human civilizations are named after them). However, the extent of usage of the former is growing at an exponential rate because of the near-infinite combinatorial possibilities. In fact, there are hardly few engineering disciplines that can potentially offer so large and endless unexploited possibilities. Plastic industries are widespread across the world due to their easy scalability, favorable economics and extremely diverse applications. Plastic manufacturing and recycling are especially important for the economy of a country and provide livelihood for a large population. It is imperative that the current processes in plastic be improved upon by the advantages offered by computational tools and digital technologies. At this stage, we desperately need new age tools that can properly guide the human enterprise of innovation in designing, perfection in processing while maintaining stringent quality requirements in manufacturing.

abstract = {Sustainable and cleaner manufacturing systems have found broad applications in industrial processes, especially aerospace, automotive and power generation. Conventional manufacturing methods are highly unsustainable regarding carbon emissions, energy consumption, material wastage, costly shipment and complex supply management. Besides, during global COVID-19 pandemic, advanced fabrication and management strategies were extremely required to fulfill the shortfall of basic and medical emergency supplies. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) reduces global energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to industrial manufacturing. Various renewable energy harvesting mechanisms utilizing solar, wind, tidal and human potential have been fabricated through additive manufacturing. 3D printing aided the manufacturing companies in combating the deficiencies of medical healthcare devices for patients and professionals globally. In this regard, 3D printed medical face shields, respiratory masks, personal protective equipment, PLA-based recyclable air filtration masks, additively manufactured ideal tissue models and new information technology (IT) based rapid manufacturing are some significant contributions of 3DP. Furthermore, a bibliometric study of 3D printing research was conducted in CiteSpace. The most influential keywords and latest research frontiers were found and the 3DP knowledge was categorized into 10 diverse research themes. The potential challenges incurred by AM industry during the pandemic were categorized in terms of design, safety, manufacturing, certification and legal issues. Significantly, this study highlights the versatile role of 3DP in battle against COVID-19 pandemic and provides up-to-date research frontiers, leading the readers to focus on the current hurdles encountered by AM industry, henceforth conduct further investigations to enhance 3DP technology.}

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been touted as a transformative technology that alters the way production is organized across geographical and organizational boundaries, yet little is known what this means for firms' internationalization of production. In this paper, we take an internalization theory perspective to hypothesize how the adoption of AM technology influences a firm's propensity to have an international production subsidiary, the number of foreign production subsidiaries that it operates, and the number of countries in which it has foreign production subsidiaries. To test our hypotheses, we rely on European Patent Office data to identify firms with AM-related patents and match this information to firm-level data of international production subsidiary networks from Bureau Van Dijk. Using both propensity score matching and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions, we find that AM firms are more likely to have a foreign production subsidiary than non-AM firms and operate them in more countries. We find partial evidence that AM firms have more foreign production subsidiaries than non-AM firms, in particular as compared to comparable innovative firms.}

Because of their advantages in reflecting the overall biological effects or functions of drugs and providing visual and intuitive results, some biotechnological analysis methods have been gradually applied to pharmaceutical analysis from raw material to manufacturing and final product analysis, including DNA super-barcoding, DNA-based rapid detection, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, hyperspectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence, 3D biologically printed organoids, omics-based artificial intelligence, microfluidic chips, organ-on-a-chip, signal transduction pathway-related reporter gene assays, and the zebrafish thrombosis model.

Their ability to produce both rapidly and precisely nano-sized products provides them with a unique set of qualities that cannot be matched by other fabrication technologies. Consequently, this has stimulated the development of EHD processing to tackle other healthcare challenges. However, as with most technologies, time and resources will be needed to realise fully the potential EHD processes can offer. To address this bottleneck, researchers are adopting machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, into their workflow. ML has already made ground-breaking advancements in the healthcare sector, and it is anticipated to do the same in the materials domain. Presently, the application of ML in fabrication technologies lags behind other sectors. To that end, this review showcases the progress made by ML for EHD workflows, demonstrating how the latter can benefit greatly from the former. In addition, we provide an introduction to the ML pipeline, to help encourage the use of ML for other EHD researchers. As discussed, the merger of ML with EHD has the potential to expedite novel discoveries and to automate the EHD workflow.}

AM of functional materials, such as magnetic materials, has received much less attention. Magnetic materials are of high and growing interest in an extremely wide range of applications, e.g., electronic devices, rotating electrical machines, electric vehicles, wind turbines, magnetic cooling, electromagnetic shielding microphones, mobiles, laptops, etc. The processing of functional materials by AM can result in novel magnetic components with improved performance and lower processing cost, motivating the present review on AM of magnetic materials. We review commonly used AM techniques, their working principles, and applications to magnetic materials. We discuss the use of the laser engineering net shaping (LENS) process to produce soft and hard magnets. This technique can also be readily employed to process compositionally graded structures for accelerated materials development through combinatorial/high throughput investigations. Such graded structures can exhibit a wide range of functional and structural properties. The structural and magnetic properties of AM processed Fe-Si, Ni-Fe, Fe-Co, soft magnetic composites, soft magnetic oxides, magnetic shape memory alloys, magnetocaloric alloys as well as high entropy alloys are described. AM of hard magnetic materials, including Alnico, Sm-Co, Nd-Fe-B and Ce-Co alloys is elucidated. The current and future trends in this area are outlined.}

This task is of vital importance in fulfilling the low energy criteria under the policies to tackle energy shortage and climate change. According to the intelligent EC modeling in 3DP, the multisource data consists in three parts including pixel-source, motion-source, and processing-source. Compared with existing solutions, which either only harness the geometric characteristics of computer-aided design (CAD) models or simply integrate the processing parameters into the prediction, the proposed 3DPECP-Net is able to seamlessly fuse relevant data in 3DP, taking full advantage of the complementary information of diverse datasources for more accurate prediction. Specifically, the multisource fusion frame (MSFF) stacks multiple transformer blocks to catch global spatial information, and convolutional blocks to catch local feature details. Furthermore, we propose a continual attention memory network (CAMN) to ably extract and store the inter-layer consistency, enforcing to efficiently learn an exhaustive representation for 3DP EC prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3DPECP-Net achieves a superior prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods.}

In this review/commentary, the current state of medicines provision in space is explored, accompanied by a forward look on the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing in outer space. The hazards associated with spaceflight, and their corresponding medical problems, are first briefly discussed. Subsequently, the infeasibility of present-day medicines provision systems for supporting deep space exploration is examined. The existing knowledge gaps on the altered clinical effects of medicines in space are evaluated, and suggestions are provided on how clinical trials in space might be conducted. An envisioned model of on-site production and delivery of medicines in space is proposed, referencing emerging technologies (e.g. Chemputing, synthetic biology, and 3D printing) being developed on Earth that may be adapted for extra-terrestrial use. This review concludes with a critical analysis on the regulatory considerations necessary to facilitate the adoption of these technologies and proposes a framework by which these may be enforced. In doing so, this commentary aims to instigate discussions on the pharmaceutical needs of deep space exploration, and strategies on how these may be met.}

In this modern era, with the advancements in manufacturing technologies, academia and industry have been given more interest in smart manufacturing for taking benefits for making their production more sustainable and effective. In the present study, the significant techniques of smart manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, and additive manufacturing are combined to make a unified term of sustainable and smart additive manufacturing (SSAM). The paper aims to develop framework by combining big data analytics, additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart manufacturing technologies which is beneficial to the additive manufacturing enterprises. So, a framework of big data-driven sustainable and smart additive manufacturing (BD-SSAM) is proposed which helped AM industry leaders to make better decisions for the beginning of life (BOL) stage of product life cycle. Finally, an application scenario of the additive manufacturing industry was presented to demonstrate the proposed framework. The proposed framework is implemented on the BOL stage of product lifecycle due to limitation of available resources and for fabrication of AlSi10Mg alloy components by using selective laser melting (SLM) technique of AM. The results indicate that energy consumption and quality of the product are adequately controlled which is helpful for smart sustainable manufacturing, emission reduction, and cleaner production.}

Additionally, polypills can be created with combinations of medications in one solid dosage form at completely customisable strengths that would be extremely difficult to obtain commercially. As the technology and formulations developed through 3D printing are expanding, the development of new hybrid materials to obtain superior formulations are also gaining momentum. In this review we collate data on the importance of developing hybrid formulations of polymers, drugs and excipients necessary to produce reliable and high-quality 3D printed dosage forms with a special emphasis on fused deposition modelling (FDM). FDM technology is one of the most widely used forms of 3D printing and has demonstrated compatibility with unique polymer-based hybrids to allow for enhanced drug delivery, protection of thermolabile drugs, modifiable release kinetics, and more. The data collated covers different categories of hybrids as well as the methods used to fabricate them, and their respective effects on the properties of 3D printed solid oral dosage forms.

The demand for health and medical related goods increased during this period globally, while the production using classical manufacturing techniques were effected because of the lockdowns and disruption in the transporation system. This created the need of geo scattered, small, and rapid manufacturing units along with a smart computer aided design (CAD) facility. The availability of 3D printing technologies and open source CAD design made it possible to overcome this need. In this article, we present an extensive review on the utilization of 3D printing technology in the days of pandamic. We observe that 3D printing together with smart CAD design show promise to overcome the disruption caused by the lockdown of classical manufacturing units specially for medical and testing equipment, and protective gears. We observe that there are several short communications, commentaries, correspondences, editorials and mini reviews compiled and published; however, a systematic state-of-the-art review is required to identify the significance of 3D printing, design for additive manufacturing (AM), and digital supply chain for handling emergency situations and in the post-COVID era. We present a review of various benefits of 3DP particularly in emergency situations such as a pandemic. Furthermore, some relevant iterative design and 3DP case studies are discussed systematically. Finally, this article highlights the areas that can help to control the emergency situation such as a pandemic, and critically discusses the research gaps that need further research in order to exploit the full potential of 3DP in pandemic and post-pandemic future era.}

We analyze sustainability in the digital supply chain by combining the supply chain SCOR model with the triple bottom line sustainability perspective that incorporates economic, environmental, and social dimensions. The complexities and trade-offs among these factors can lead to unintended consequences for sustainability initiatives. We consider two illustrative case studies: the emerging supply chains for electric passenger vehicles and the beef supply chain. Automotive and agricultural supply chains have to deal with substantial and complex sustainability issues. We identify how digital technologies may support sustainability initiatives or create unintended negative consequences. We draw insights from the two cases to discuss important issues and questions for both research and practice. Given the importance of sustainability, we highlight the need to consider carefully all the consequences of applying digital technologies in order to achieve intended benefits and reduce unintended harm.}

abstract = {Summary
Mantis shrimps use their dactyl club to strike multiple high-velocity impacts against stiff and hard surfaces. To sustain the loads and dissipate energy, their club has evolved a complex multiscale organization segmented in an impact surface, an impact region, and a periodic region. Composed essentially of nanoparticles, mineralized chitin microfibers, and proteins, each region exhibits microstructural specificities linked to energy-dissipating mechanisms. Fabricating synthetic materials that exploit similar organizations and mechanisms could lead to the development of lightweight impact-resistant strategies for a multitude of applications. To this aim, the microstructure and properties of the natural dactyl club and its key toughening mechanisms are reviewed, as well as current and potential fabrication approaches. Challenges and limitations of those approaches are discussed to hopefully help guide future research on bioinspired impact-resistant materials.}

abstract = {A Smart Circular Supply Chain (SCSC) integrates both Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy (CE) concepts into supply chain in response to achieving sustainable goals/agenda. The purpose of this paper is to assess SCSC readiness and maturity level of SMEs considering different stakeholders from a multi-layered perspective. For this aim, a conceptual framework was proposed and accomplished through a case study of SMEs in Turkey’s textile industry. Such integrated approach to holistically assessing SCSC readiness and maturity makes a unique contribution to the field. The highlights of this study are summarized as follows: (1) approaching readiness and maturity in transitions by focusing on systems theory; (2) identifying the dimensions of readiness and maturity in transitions to I4.0 and CE; (3) assessment of readiness and maturity level of SMEs in transition to CE and (4) assessment of readiness and maturity level of SMEs in transition to I4.0 within the supply chain.}

abstract = {Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm.}
